# react-redux-example

Exploring react, redux, and react-router (v4!)
This is mostly a template I am building for myself as I am exploring some architecture options.

## How to set up your development environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidharting/react-redux-example.git
npm install
npm start
```

That will fire up a hot-reloading development server with webpack. You can start playing from there!
